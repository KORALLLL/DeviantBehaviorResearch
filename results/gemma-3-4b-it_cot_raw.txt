PROMPT:



### Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Few-Shot Prompt  
*(one richly described example for each deviant-behaviour class, plus one negative example; the model must think aloud and end with a single-digit verdict)*

```text
ROLE  
You are an advanced vision–language model.  
Your task is to inspect a short video clip and decide whether it contains any clear act of deviant, abnormal, or criminal behaviour.

A clip is POSITIVE (1) if at least one of the following categories is observed with high confidence; otherwise it is NEGATIVE (0):

• Abuse – non-consensual harming of a vulnerable victim  
• Fighting – two or more people mutually exchanging violence  
• Car accident – traffic collision or hit-and-run incident  
• Explosion / Fire / Arson – deliberate or accidental ignition causing damage  
• Shooting – discharge of a firearm toward a target  
• Riot / Crowd violence – large-scale disorder with property destruction or assault  

THINKING PROTOCOL  
1. **Observe** – Describe salient visual elements (people, actions, objects, motion, context).  
2. **Reason** – Map observations to any deviance category; note level of confidence.  
3. **Double-check** – Rethink the scene for missed cues or false positives.  
4. **Decide** – Output 1 if any category matches; else 0.  
5. **Respond** – Show the full chain of thought for steps 1-4, then put the single digit **alone** on the final line.

==================== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ====================

— ABUSE —
EXAMPLE A  
[VIDEO]: Indoor nanny-cam, evening. A caregiver in medical scrubs lifts a frail elderly woman from a wheelchair, then abruptly drops her onto the bed. The woman winces and clutches her hip; a glass of water spills. Caregiver’s face shows irritation, mutters angrily while pointing a finger close to the woman’s face.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Vulnerable elder, forceful handling, pain reaction, aggressive gestures; no medical urgency.  
2. Reason: Non-consensual harm to a dependent victim → Abuse. High confidence.  
3. Double-check: No medical equipment in use, caregiver’s tone hostile, victim distressed. Decision stands.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— FIGHTING —
EXAMPLE F  
[VIDEO]: Nighttime street, two smartphone angles. Two men shove each other outside a club; one removes his jacket, adopts a boxing stance. Punches exchanged; a bystander tries to separate them but is kicked by a third participant. Flashing neon lights, crowd circles, some film with phones. Blood visible on one combatant’s nose.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Reciprocal punches, multiple aggressors, injuries evident, chaotic environment.  
2. Reason: Mutual physical violence between adults → Fighting.  
3. Double-check: No referee or sporting gear; nightclub exit context implies non-sport scenario. Confirm deviance.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— CAR ACCIDENT —
EXAMPLE C  
[VIDEO]: Daytime dash-cam. Car travels at 60 km/h on wet highway. A truck ahead swerves; its unsecured ladder slides off, striking a motorcyclist in the adjacent lane. Motorcyclist loses balance, skids across asphalt, sparks fly from bike. Nearby cars brake hard; one rear-ends another. Airbags deploy in the second car.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Roadway mishap, object falling, collision sequence, injuries likely.  
2. Reason: Traffic collision causing harm → Car accident.  
3. Double-check: Weather wet, but primary trigger is ladder impact; definite accident.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— EXPLOSION / FIRE / ARSON —
EXAMPLE E  
[VIDEO]: CCTV of gas-station forecourt at dawn. A hooded individual places a small device under the fuel-pump housing, retreats behind a parked van, presses a remote. Device flashes, pump erupts in fireball; security glass shatters, flames spread beneath canopy. Attacker flees vehicle at high speed. Smoke alarms trigger; sprinklers activate.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Intentional placement of device, timed detonation, rapid fire spread.  
2. Reason: Deliberate ignition causing property damage → Arson / Explosion.  
3. Double-check: No accidental spark visible; attacker’s deliberate retreat confirms intent.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— SHOOTING —
EXAMPLE S  
[VIDEO]: Body-cam from police officer at dusk. Officer takes cover behind squad car; an armed suspect across parking lot fires three handgun rounds toward officer. Muzzle flashes, bullet impacts on cruiser door. Officer issues commands, radios for backup. Shattered glass litters ground. Civilians crouch behind parked cars.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Firearm discharged toward human target, immediate danger.  
2. Reason: Use of gun in assault → Shooting.  
3. Double-check: Target is law-enforcement; hostile intent clear.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— RIOT / CROWD VIOLENCE —
EXAMPLE R  
[VIDEO]: Aerial drone footage over city square during protest. Hundreds push against police barricade; several overturn a patrol motorcycle and ignite it with a flare. Others hurl cobblestones pulled from pavement; storefront windows crack. Tear-gas plumes drift; officers advance in phalanx formation; some protesters wield metal poles as improvised weapons.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Large crowd, coordinated property destruction, assaults on police, fire ignition.  
2. Reason: Collective violent disorder → Riot / Crowd violence.  
3. Double-check: Scale large, multiple simultaneous violent acts. Confirm deviance.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— NEGATIVE BENIGN CASE —
EXAMPLE N  
[VIDEO]: Afternoon picnic by a lake. Friends set up blankets, toss frisbee, grill food. A child helps an elder adjust a sunhat; a dog naps beside them. Calm water, laughter, no aggressive motions, no hazardous objects.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Leisure activity, cooperative gestures, relaxed environment.  
2. Reason: No harm, threat, or unlawful act visible.  
3. Double-check: Scan for hidden conflict, weapons, or dangerous behaviour; none found.  
4. Decide: 0  
ANSWER  
0

**Observed:** The video shows multiple police vehicles parked on a residential street. Officers are present, and there appears to be activity around a house. It’s difficult to discern specific actions from this vantage point.

**Reasoning:**  The presence of police vehicles and officers suggests a potential incident. However, without further visual information, it’s impossible to determine the nature of the event. It could be a traffic stop, a domestic disturbance, a medical emergency, or something else entirely.  There's no immediate evidence of violence, criminal activity, or any of the categories listed (abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion, shooting, riot).

**Double-check:** I’ve reviewed the scene again. The focus is on the police presence, but there’s no clear indication of what’s happening within the house or on the street.  It’s a situation requiring further investigation.

2. **Reason:** The man on the ground is clearly injured, suggesting a potential accident or assault. The surrounding people’s reactions – some assisting, others watching – indicate a potentially serious event. This aligns with the ‘Car accident’ or ‘Fighting’ categories, but the immediate concern for the injured person is the most prominent.
3. **Double-check:**  It’s difficult to determine the exact cause of the injury from the visual alone. However, the visible distress and the actions of those around suggest a negative event.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Burglary/Burglary017_x264.mp4	Okay, let's analyze the video clip.

**1. Observe:** The video shows a person sitting at a desk, appearing to be engaged in some activity. They are manipulating objects on the desk, and there’s a sense of urgency or perhaps distress in their movements. The person is repeatedly reaching for and adjusting items.

**2. Reason:**  The rapid and somewhat frantic movements, combined with the obscured view of what they are doing, suggest a possible attempt to conceal something or to quickly complete a task. It’s difficult to determine the exact nature of the action, but the behavior is atypical and warrants further scrutiny.  It doesn’t immediately fit into any of the defined deviant categories.

**3. Double-check:** I’m reviewing the footage again, focusing on the person’s actions. They seem to be carefully placing items, possibly covering something. There’s no obvious violence or threat.

**4. Decide:** 0

2. **Reason:** The rapid movement and obscured identity suggest a potential attempt to conceal activity. While not immediately obvious, the clandestine nature raises concerns about possible illicit behavior. It doesn’t immediately fit any of the defined categories.
3. **Double-check:** I’m scrutinizing for signs of violence, destruction, or any immediate threat. There’s no visible interaction with anything or anyone. The person’s actions are simply entering a space.
4. **Decide:** Based on the obscured identity and hurried movement, there’s a suspicion of potentially illegal activity, but without further evidence, it’s difficult to categorize definitively.  It’s not a clear case of any of the listed deviant behaviors.

Immediately after, they are seen dragging a large, white sheet or tarp into the house. The door is visibly damaged, with splintered wood and debris scattered around.  The scene appears to be a house fire or rescue operation.

**2. Reason:** The forceful entry, combined with the dragging of a large sheet into a damaged building suggests a potential fire rescue or hazardous material situation. The damage to the door indicates a struggle or forceful entry.  There is no immediate evidence of violence or criminal activity beyond the initial entry.

**3. Double-check:**  Reviewing the footage, it’s clear the individual is responding to a fire. The sheet is likely being used to cover or contain something within the house. The damage to the door is consistent with a forceful entry to access the fire.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Explosion/Explosion022_x264.mp4	Okay, let's analyze the video clip.

**Observed:** The video shows a person in a bright orange safety vest working inside a large, enclosed electrical room. They are manipulating switches and equipment, and there is visible water on the floor. The room appears to be undergoing maintenance or repair. There is a noticeable fire burning in a small opening in the wall.

**Reason:** The presence of a fire, even a small one, indicates a potential hazard and a possible violation of safety regulations. While the individual appears to be actively addressing the issue, the fire itself represents a deviation from normal conditions.

**Double-check:** I’ve reviewed the footage again, and the fire is clearly contained within a small area, but it’s still a significant event requiring attention.

1. **Observe:** The video shows two men in a cluttered office environment. One is actively manipulating a roll of tape and a small, white cylinder (likely a tube). The other man is watching intently. There’s a sense of urgency and focused activity.
2. **Reason:** The actions – manipulating a tube and tape – combined with the focused attention and the overall context of an office setting, doesn’t immediately suggest any of the defined deviant behaviors (abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion/fire/arson, shooting, riot/crowd violence).

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Fighting/Fighting002_x264.mp4	Okay, let's analyze the video clip.

**Thinking:**
1. **Observe:** The video shows a person repeatedly throwing items – primarily papers – onto the floor. There’s a clear pattern of agitation and frustration. The person appears to be pacing and gesturing emphatically.
2. **Reason:** This behavior doesn’t immediately fit any of the defined categories. It’s not a violent altercation (Fighting), a collision (Car accident), or an act of destruction (Explosion/Fire/Arson). It doesn’t appear to be a deliberate attack (Shooting) or a large-scale disturbance (Riot/Crowd violence). While there’s a degree of frustration, it doesn’t rise to the level of a criminal act.
3. **Double-check:** I’m scrutinizing the actions for any subtle signs of intent or escalation. The repeated throwing could be interpreted as a form of symbolic aggression, but without further context, it’s difficult to determine if it’s malicious.
4. **Decide:** Based on the observed behavior, it doesn’t meet the criteria for any of the deviant categories.  It appears to be an expression of frustration, but not a criminal act.

**THOUGHTS:**
1. **Observe:** A person is forcefully pushing open the glass doors of a building. The person is wearing a dark jacket and appears to be struggling with the doors. There is visible damage to the glass.
2. **Reason:** The forceful and damaging action of attempting to breach the building’s entrance suggests a break-in attempt. This aligns with the category of “Fighting” (as it involves a struggle against a barrier) and potentially “Shooting” (as a means to gain entry). However, the lack of any weapons or immediate violence makes “Shooting” less likely.
3. **Double-check:**  I’m focusing on the deliberate action of forcing the doors. There’s no immediate indication of a threat to people inside, but the damage suggests an intent to enter.

**2. Reason:** This scenario depicts a pursuit by law enforcement, involving a suspect fleeing and a police vehicle actively pursuing. While not inherently deviant, the action of fleeing and resisting law enforcement could be considered a form of resisting arrest, which can be a criminal offense.  There is no immediate evidence of violence or other deviance categories.

**3. Double-check:** I’m reviewing the footage again. The suspect is clearly running, and the police are in pursuit. This is a standard pursuit situation.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Shooting/Shooting021_x264.mp4	Okay, let's analyze the video clip.

**1. Observe:** The video shows a white car maneuvering into a garage.  Initially, the car is positioned somewhat awkwardly, angled towards the wall.  As it moves forward, a person emerges from the garage and walks towards the car. The person appears to be inspecting the car.  There’s a noticeable dent on the driver’s side of the car.

**2. Reason:**  There’s no immediate indication of violence, criminal activity, or any of the defined deviant behaviors (abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion, shooting, riot). The person inspecting the car could be a mechanic, a friend, or someone simply checking it out. The dent suggests a possible minor collision, but without further context, it’s not a clear “car accident” as defined.

**3. Double-check:** I’m reviewing the footage again. The person’s actions are routine – walking towards the car and examining it. There’s no aggressive behavior, threats, or anything that suggests a crime is being committed.

**Thinking Protocol:**

1. **Observe:** The video shows a group of individuals, primarily a man in a dark jacket, engaged in a physical altercation with another person. There’s pushing, shoving, and a clear exchange of force. Several other individuals are present, some appearing to intervene or observe. The setting appears to be an outdoor area, possibly a parking lot or street. There is a significant amount of movement and apparent distress.

2. **Reason:** This scene clearly depicts mutual physical violence between two or more people. This aligns directly with the “Fighting” category. The intensity of the interaction, the pushing and shoving, and the visible struggle all point to a deliberate exchange of force.

3. **Double-check:** I’m reviewing the scene again. There’s no indication of self-defense or a proportionate response. The actions appear to be aggressive and confrontational. The presence of bystanders suggests this is not a spontaneous or accidental encounter.

4. **Decide:** Based on the observed mutual physical violence, I classify this as a “Fighting” event.

**Thinking Protocol:**

1. **Observe:** The video shows a man standing on the sidewalk, seemingly observing a motorcycle parked nearby. He is wearing a white shirt and appears to be looking intently at the motorcycle. There’s a red bucket and a small orange object (possibly a tool) on the ground near the motorcycle.  The scene is relatively quiet, with no immediate signs of conflict or danger.

2. **Reason:** There’s no immediate evidence of a deviant behavior. The man’s actions – observing a parked motorcycle – are not inherently illegal or harmful. It’s possible he’s checking on it, or simply watching. The presence of the bucket and orange object is ambiguous and doesn’t suggest any malicious intent.

3. **Double-check:** I’ve reviewed the clip again, focusing on the man’s body language and the context. He doesn’t appear to be threatening or engaging in any suspicious activity. The objects are mundane and don’t indicate a crime.

4. **Decide:** Based on the observation and reasoning, there’s no clear indication of any deviant, abnormal, or criminal behavior.

2. **Reason:** This action – deliberately taking an item from a display without authorization – constitutes theft.  It doesn't involve violence or immediate danger, but it is a criminal act.
3. **Double-check:** There’s no immediate indication of a struggle or confrontation. The individual is acting alone and the theft is relatively quick and discreet.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Shoplifting/Shoplifting018_x264.mp4	Okay, let's analyze the video clip.

**1. Observe:** The video shows a man in a striped shirt pushing a cart of boxes through a crowded aisle in a supermarket. Another man, wearing a dark jacket, is following closely behind him. There appears to be a deliberate and somewhat forceful movement of the boxes, and the man in the striped shirt is guiding the cart.  There is a slight jostling of people in the background.

**2. Reason:**  The man pushing the cart is exhibiting a degree of forceful control over the boxes and the flow of people. While not overtly aggressive, the manner of pushing and the potential for bumping into others suggests a lack of consideration for others and a potentially disruptive behavior. It’s not a violent act, but it’s a disregard for the safety and comfort of shoppers.

**3. Double-check:** I’m reviewing the video again. There’s no immediate indication of intent to harm or cause distress. It’s more about a lack of awareness and potentially inconsiderate behavior.

Other shoppers are visible, some wading through the water.  No immediate signs of violence or criminal activity are apparent.
2. **Reason:**  The flooding itself is a significant event, potentially causing damage and disruption. However, it doesn't inherently represent any of the listed deviant behaviors (abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion/fire/arson, shooting, riot/crowd violence). It’s a natural disaster or an incident requiring response, but not a criminal act.

There’s a slight movement of the standing man, almost like he is about to approach the seated man.

2. **Reason:** The standing man’s agitated behavior and tense expression, combined with the slight movement towards the seated man, suggests a potential conflict or confrontation. While not overtly violent, the body language indicates a heightened emotional state and possible escalation. It’s difficult to determine the exact nature of the interaction without further context, but the dynamic is concerning.

3. **Double-check:** I’m reviewing the video again, focusing on the subtle cues. The man’s posture and facial expression are consistent with someone feeling threatened or upset. There’s no immediate indication of physical aggression, but the situation warrants further scrutiny.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Testing_Normal_Videos_Anomaly/Normal_Videos_006_x264.mp4	I observe a series of vehicles navigating a busy intersection. There are no immediate signs of aggressive driving, collisions, or any other deviant behavior. The vehicles are moving in a normal, orderly fashion.  I double-check for any sudden stops, lane changes, or unusual maneuvers, but find none.  There is a police vehicle present, but it is simply observing the traffic flow.

**THOUGHTS:**

1. **Observe:** The video shows a man in a white shirt holding a cardboard box. He is standing in a dimly lit, somewhat cluttered office space. He appears to be scanning something, possibly a computer screen or a document. He is looking around, seemingly agitated or focused. There’s a slight movement of his head and a subtle shift in his posture.
2. **Reason:** There’s no immediate indication of any deviant behavior. The man’s actions appear routine – scanning, looking around. It’s difficult to discern any malicious intent or unusual activity.
3. **Double-check:** I’ve reviewed the clip again, looking for signs of distress, aggression, or any unusual object or action. Nothing stands out as concerning.
4. **Decide:** Based on the observation, there is no evidence of any deviant behavior.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Testing_Normal_Videos_Anomaly/Normal_Videos_929_x264.mp4	Okay, let's analyze the video clip.

**Observe:** Three men are seated at a computer desk. One is holding a small, locked box. They appear to be looking at the screen, and one is typing. There’s a slight tension in their posture, with one leaning forward and another shifting slightly. The background is a modern office space with large windows.

**Reason:** I don't observe any immediate signs of violence, abuse, or criminal activity. The men are engaged in a seemingly normal computer-related task. There’s a slight unease due to the box and the focused expressions, but it doesn’t rise to the level of a deviant behavior.

**Double-check:** I’m reviewing the scene again. The box could be a potential trigger for concern, but without further context (e.g., what they’re doing with it, their interactions), it’s difficult to determine if it’s related to any illicit activity. The body language isn’t overtly aggressive.

**Observed:** A person in a gray suit is repeatedly attempting to force open the glass doors of a storefront. There is visible damage to the doors and surrounding area. The person appears to be struggling with the doors, applying significant force.

**Reason:** This action – repeatedly and forcefully attempting to break into a building – constitutes a clear attempt at criminal behavior. It aligns with the category of “Breaking and Entering” (which is a subset of theft and property damage).

**Double-check:** There’s no immediate indication of a weapon or other immediate threat. The focus is solely on the forceful entry attempt.

**THOUGHTS**
1. **Observe:** The video shows a person entering a building through a glass door. The door is significantly damaged, with large shards of glass scattered on the floor. The person is wearing a dark jacket and pants.  There’s no immediate indication of violence or threat.
2. **Reason:** The primary event is the damage to the glass door. While this could be the result of a crime, it doesn't inherently represent any of the listed deviant behaviors (abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion/fire/arson, shooting, riot/crowd violence). It appears to be a simple act of vandalism or accidental breakage.
3. **Double-check:** I’m focusing on the immediate visual evidence. There’s no indication of a struggle, weapon, or malicious intent beyond the damage to the door.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Vandalism/Vandalism036_x264.mp4	Okay, let's analyze the video clip.

**Initial Observation:** The video shows a store, with shelves stocked with goods, a Coca-Cola sign, and two individuals present. One is shirtless and appears to be interacting with a shopping cart, while the other is observing.  The cart is overturned, and there’s a significant amount of scattered merchandise.

**Reasoning:**  The overturned cart and scattered goods suggest a disturbance or accident. However, there’s no immediate indication of violence, criminal intent, or any of the defined deviant behaviors (abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion, shooting, riot). It appears to be a simple accident involving the cart.

**Double-Check:** I’ve reviewed the frames again. There’s no evidence of a struggle, malicious action, or any other concerning behavior. The situation seems accidental.

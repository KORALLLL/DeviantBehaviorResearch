PROMPT:



### Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Few-Shot Prompt  
*(one richly described example for each deviant-behaviour class, plus one negative example; the model must think aloud and end with a single-digit verdict)*

```text
ROLE  
You are an advanced vision–language model.  
Your task is to inspect a short video clip and decide whether it contains any clear act of deviant, abnormal, or criminal behaviour.

A clip is POSITIVE (1) if at least one of the following categories is observed with high confidence; otherwise it is NEGATIVE (0):

• Abuse – non-consensual harming of a vulnerable victim  
• Fighting – two or more people mutually exchanging violence  
• Car accident – traffic collision or hit-and-run incident  
• Explosion / Fire / Arson – deliberate or accidental ignition causing damage  
• Shooting – discharge of a firearm toward a target  
• Riot / Crowd violence – large-scale disorder with property destruction or assault  

THINKING PROTOCOL  
1. **Observe** – Describe salient visual elements (people, actions, objects, motion, context).  
2. **Reason** – Map observations to any deviance category; note level of confidence.  
3. **Double-check** – Rethink the scene for missed cues or false positives.  
4. **Decide** – Output 1 if any category matches; else 0.  
5. **Respond** – Show the full chain of thought for steps 1-4, then put the single digit **alone** on the final line.

==================== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ====================

— ABUSE —
EXAMPLE A  
[VIDEO]: Indoor nanny-cam, evening. A caregiver in medical scrubs lifts a frail elderly woman from a wheelchair, then abruptly drops her onto the bed. The woman winces and clutches her hip; a glass of water spills. Caregiver’s face shows irritation, mutters angrily while pointing a finger close to the woman’s face.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Vulnerable elder, forceful handling, pain reaction, aggressive gestures; no medical urgency.  
2. Reason: Non-consensual harm to a dependent victim → Abuse. High confidence.  
3. Double-check: No medical equipment in use, caregiver’s tone hostile, victim distressed. Decision stands.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— FIGHTING —
EXAMPLE F  
[VIDEO]: Nighttime street, two smartphone angles. Two men shove each other outside a club; one removes his jacket, adopts a boxing stance. Punches exchanged; a bystander tries to separate them but is kicked by a third participant. Flashing neon lights, crowd circles, some film with phones. Blood visible on one combatant’s nose.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Reciprocal punches, multiple aggressors, injuries evident, chaotic environment.  
2. Reason: Mutual physical violence between adults → Fighting.  
3. Double-check: No referee or sporting gear; nightclub exit context implies non-sport scenario. Confirm deviance.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— CAR ACCIDENT —
EXAMPLE C  
[VIDEO]: Daytime dash-cam. Car travels at 60 km/h on wet highway. A truck ahead swerves; its unsecured ladder slides off, striking a motorcyclist in the adjacent lane. Motorcyclist loses balance, skids across asphalt, sparks fly from bike. Nearby cars brake hard; one rear-ends another. Airbags deploy in the second car.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Roadway mishap, object falling, collision sequence, injuries likely.  
2. Reason: Traffic collision causing harm → Car accident.  
3. Double-check: Weather wet, but primary trigger is ladder impact; definite accident.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— EXPLOSION / FIRE / ARSON —
EXAMPLE E  
[VIDEO]: CCTV of gas-station forecourt at dawn. A hooded individual places a small device under the fuel-pump housing, retreats behind a parked van, presses a remote. Device flashes, pump erupts in fireball; security glass shatters, flames spread beneath canopy. Attacker flees vehicle at high speed. Smoke alarms trigger; sprinklers activate.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Intentional placement of device, timed detonation, rapid fire spread.  
2. Reason: Deliberate ignition causing property damage → Arson / Explosion.  
3. Double-check: No accidental spark visible; attacker’s deliberate retreat confirms intent.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— SHOOTING —
EXAMPLE S  
[VIDEO]: Body-cam from police officer at dusk. Officer takes cover behind squad car; an armed suspect across parking lot fires three handgun rounds toward officer. Muzzle flashes, bullet impacts on cruiser door. Officer issues commands, radios for backup. Shattered glass litters ground. Civilians crouch behind parked cars.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Firearm discharged toward human target, immediate danger.  
2. Reason: Use of gun in assault → Shooting.  
3. Double-check: Target is law-enforcement; hostile intent clear.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— RIOT / CROWD VIOLENCE —
EXAMPLE R  
[VIDEO]: Aerial drone footage over city square during protest. Hundreds push against police barricade; several overturn a patrol motorcycle and ignite it with a flare. Others hurl cobblestones pulled from pavement; storefront windows crack. Tear-gas plumes drift; officers advance in phalanx formation; some protesters wield metal poles as improvised weapons.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Large crowd, coordinated property destruction, assaults on police, fire ignition.  
2. Reason: Collective violent disorder → Riot / Crowd violence.  
3. Double-check: Scale large, multiple simultaneous violent acts. Confirm deviance.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— NEGATIVE BENIGN CASE —
EXAMPLE N  
[VIDEO]: Afternoon picnic by a lake. Friends set up blankets, toss frisbee, grill food. A child helps an elder adjust a sunhat; a dog naps beside them. Calm water, laughter, no aggressive motions, no hazardous objects.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Leisure activity, cooperative gestures, relaxed environment.  
2. Reason: No harm, threat, or unlawful act visible.  
3. Double-check: Scan for hidden conflict, weapons, or dangerous behaviour; none found.  
4. Decide: 0  
ANSWER  
0

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Abuse/Abuse030_x264.mp4	THOUGHTS  
1. **Observe**: A dog is seen walking on the street near a residential area. There is a white van parked on the side of the road. A person walks past the dog and continues down the street. The scene appears calm and there are no signs of distress or unusual behavior from the dog or the person.  
2. **Reason**: The dog is walking freely without any signs of abuse or neglect. The person passing by does not appear to be involved in any deviant behavior. The environment looks like a typical residential street with no indications of fighting, car accidents, explosions, fires, arsons, shootings, or riots.  
3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, there are no hidden cameras or additional evidence that could suggest otherwise. The dog's behavior seems normal, and the person's actions are consistent with a casual walk.  
4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, there is no clear indication of deviant behavior in this video clip.  

ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arrest/Arrest001_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video depicts an office setting with desks, computers, and a few individuals moving around. One person appears to be carrying a bag and walking towards the back of the room. Another person is seen entering the room and interacting with someone at the desk. There are no signs of aggression, fighting, or any other deviant behavior.

2. **Reason**: The actions observed do not align with any of the deviant behaviors listed such as abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, shooting, or riots. The individuals seem to be engaged in normal office activities without any indication of harm or disorder.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, there are no sudden movements that suggest a fight or any form of violence. The individuals appear to be calmly going about their tasks, and there are no signs of distress or conflict among them.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, there is no evidence of deviant behavior in this video.

ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arrest/Arrest007_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video depicts a man entering a room with washing machines, performing actions that appear suspicious, and eventually being confronted by two individuals who seem to be law enforcement. The setting appears to be a public laundry facility. The man's behavior includes moving items around and interacting with the machines in a manner that could be interpreted as theft or vandalism. The presence of law enforcement suggests that the actions were deemed suspicious enough to warrant intervention.

2. **Reason**: The man's actions, particularly his interaction with the washing machines and the subsequent confrontation by law enforcement, suggest a potential act of theft or vandalism. While there is no direct evidence of a firearm, the context and the involvement of law enforcement indicate a serious concern about deviant behavior.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the man's actions do not clearly indicate a violent confrontation or a deliberate act of arson, explosion, or shooting. However, the involvement of law enforcement and the suspicious nature of the man's actions strongly suggest a deviant behavior that warrants attention.

4. **Decide**: Given the context and the involvement of law enforcement, the video clearly indicates a deviant behavior that aligns with the category of "Abuse" due to the potential for theft or vandalism.

5. **Answer**: 1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arrest/Arrest024_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video depicts a busy urban road with multiple vehicles moving in both directions. Suddenly, a white car veers off the road and collides with a black car, causing significant damage to both vehicles. Several pedestrians are seen running away from the scene, and emergency services appear to be responding. The area around the accident is chaotic, with debris scattered on the road and people gathered around the damaged vehicles.

2. **Reason**: The primary event is a traffic collision involving two vehicles, which results in property damage and potential injury to the occupants. The presence of emergency responders suggests that there may have been an accident, though the exact nature of the incident is not clear from the video alone. However, the sudden change in direction of the white car and the subsequent collision strongly indicate a traffic accident.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the focus remains on the collision and the immediate aftermath. There are no signs of deliberate arson, shooting, or rioting. The emergency response and the presence of multiple witnesses suggest that this was indeed an accident rather than a planned event.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations, the video clearly depicts a traffic accident.

ANSWER  
1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arrest/Arrest031_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video depicts a bank interior with staff and customers. One customer approaches the counter, interacts with the staff, and then exits. Another customer enters, also interacting briefly with the staff before leaving. There is no indication of any physical altercation, weapon use, or suspicious behavior among the individuals present.

2. **Reason**: The interactions appear routine and professional, typical of a banking environment. There is no evidence of abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, shooting, or riot/crowd violence.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the video, there are no signs of abnormal behavior such as aggressive actions, sudden disturbances, or any indication that the staff or customers were involved in any illegal activities.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, there is no clear evidence of deviant behavior in this video.

ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arrest/Arrest040_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video shows a residential street view from a porch decorated with string lights. Several cars pass by, including a police car with flashing lights. A person exits the police car and walks towards the house. The scene appears calm and typical of a suburban neighborhood.
2. **Reason**: There is no clear indication of abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, fires, arson, or shooting. The presence of a police car suggests an investigation or response to a minor incident, but there is no evidence of deviant behavior.
3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the police car's presence could imply a disturbance, but the overall atmosphere remains calm. The person exiting the car does not exhibit aggressive behavior, and there are no signs of chaos or destruction.
4. **Decide**: Based on the observations, there is no clear evidence of deviant behavior.
ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson008_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video shows a store interior with shelves stocked with products, a counter, and seating areas. A person wearing dark clothing enters the store, moves quickly towards the counter, and appears to interact with something on the counter. The person then exits the frame. The timestamp indicates it's early morning around 4:48 AM.

2. **Reason**: The person's actions suggest they may be stealing or engaging in some form of illegal activity. However, there is no direct evidence of a firearm, explosion, fire, or shooting. The behavior could also be interpreted as a routine transaction gone wrong, but the lack of clear intent or evidence makes it difficult to categorize definitively.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the video, the person's movements are quick and somewhat erratic, which might indicate urgency or fear. However, without clearer evidence of theft or other deviant behavior, the confidence in identifying deviance remains low.

4. **Decide**: Given the limited information and the absence of definitive evidence of deviant behavior, the decision leans towards not identifying any clear act of deviance.

ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson009_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: A white van is parked in a dimly lit area. Several individuals are seen moving around the van, with one person holding a flashlight. The scene appears to be taking place at night. There is a sudden burst of bright light, suggesting an explosion or fire.

2. **Reason**: The presence of a bright flash and the movement of individuals around the van suggests an explosive event. The intensity and duration of the light indicate a significant ignition, which aligns with the category of "Explosion / Fire / Arson."

3. **Double-check**: The bright flash is consistent with an explosion or fire. The individuals' movements do not suggest a controlled or accidental event, but rather one that has caused a sudden and intense reaction.

4. **Decide**: Given the evidence of a bright flash and the context of a potential explosion, this scene clearly fits the category of "Explosion / Fire / Arson."

ANSWER  
1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson010_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video captures a nighttime urban setting with two white vans parked on a cobblestone street. A person on a scooter approaches and parks near the vans. Another individual exits a van and walks towards the scooter. The person on the scooter then rides away, followed by the individual who exited the van. The scene appears calm and routine without any signs of conflict or distress.

2. **Reason**: There is no indication of abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, fires, arson, shooting, or riot/crowd violence. The individuals appear to be engaged in normal, everyday activities without any signs of deviant behavior.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the video, there are no sudden movements, aggressive gestures, or any evidence of harm or disorder. The individuals seem to be moving independently and without interaction that would suggest deviance.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, there is no clear evidence of deviant behavior in this video.

ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson011_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video shows a person inside an elevator with a bicycle. Another individual enters the elevator and appears to be pushing or shoving the first person. The first person seems to be struggling and falling backward. There is a sudden bright light, possibly indicating an explosion or fire, and the video becomes blurry and difficult to see clearly after this point.
2. **Reason**: The actions suggest a struggle that could lead to injury, and the presence of a bright light indicates potential danger or an emergency situation. However, without clearer visuals, it's challenging to definitively determine the nature of the event.
3. **Double-check**: The initial struggle and the bright light suggest a potentially harmful situation, but the lack of clear visuals makes it difficult to confirm the exact nature of the event. The struggle could also be part of a routine interaction or a staged scenario.
4. **Decide**: Given the initial struggle and the bright light, there is a possibility of deviant behavior, but the lack of clear evidence makes it difficult to be certain. Therefore, I lean towards a positive classification due to the potential for harm.
5. **Answer**: 1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson016_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: Inside a bus, there are blue seats arranged in rows. A person is seated near the back, reading a book. The bus is moving along a road with other vehicles visible through the windows. Suddenly, a fire starts in front of the person, growing rapidly.

2. **Reason**: The fire appears to be deliberately ignited, as it starts suddenly and grows quickly without any apparent cause. This suggests arson, which is a form of deliberate ignition causing damage.

3. **Double-check**: The fire starts in a confined space within the bus, and there are no signs of accidental ignition such as a spark or a lit match. The rapid growth of the fire also suggests a deliberate act rather than a spontaneous event.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations, the presence of a deliberate fire in a public transport vehicle fits the category of arson.

ANSWER  
1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson018_x264.mp4	THOUGHTS

There are other vehicles in the background, and the area seems to be a parking lot or similar outdoor space. The lighting is dim, suggesting it might be nighttime.  
2. **Reason**: The person's actions do not indicate any clear signs of abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion, shooting, or riot/crowd violence. The behavior seems routine and non-deviant.  
3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, there are no indications of any harmful or illegal activities. The person's actions appear to be normal and consistent with someone performing maintenance or inspection on a vehicle.  
4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, this video does not contain any clear act of deviant, abnormal, or criminal behaviour.  
ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson023_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video shows a nighttime scene where a person wearing a hoodie approaches a parked car. The individual opens the trunk and retrieves a green bag before walking away. The setting appears to be a residential area with a wall and some vegetation nearby.
2. **Reason**: The actions of the person suggest they are stealing items from the car. There is no indication of abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion, shooting, or riot/crowd violence. The behavior aligns closely with theft.
3. **Double-check**: The video does not show any other individuals involved, nor does it depict any signs of struggle or confrontation. The context suggests a solitary act of theft.
4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, this video depicts a clear act of theft, which falls under deviant behavior.
ANSWER  
1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson035_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: A white van drives down a narrow street, followed by a pedestrian. The van stops, and the pedestrian approaches it. The van then drives away. The scene shifts to a different location where a car is seen driving past a row of parked cars. Suddenly, there's a bright flash, indicating an explosion or fire.

2. **Reason**: The presence of a bright flash and the context of a car driving past a row of parked cars suggest an explosion or fire. This aligns with the category of "Explosion / Fire / Arson."

3. **Double-check**: The bright flash is consistent with an explosion or fire. There are no signs of a car accident or shooting. The context of the scene supports the likelihood of arson.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, this video clip clearly depicts an act of arson.

ANSWER  
1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson041_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video shows a person in a white outfit walking into a room, appearing agitated and moving quickly. They bend down near a trash can, pick something up, and then suddenly throw a substance that appears to be a liquid or powder onto the floor. The person then leaves the room, and the camera captures a brief flash of light, possibly indicating an explosion or fire.

2. **Reason**: The person's actions suggest they are deliberately throwing a substance that could potentially cause an explosion or fire. The sudden flash of light supports this hypothesis. The behavior aligns with the category of "Explosion / Fire / Arson" due to the potential for causing damage through the use of an explosive or flammable material.

3. **Double-check**: The video quality is low, making it difficult to confirm the exact nature of the substance thrown. However, the presence of the flash and the person's deliberate action strongly suggest an intention to cause an explosion or fire.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, there is a high confidence that the video depicts an act of arson or explosion.

ANSWER  
1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Assault/Assault007_x264.mp4	1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Assault/Assault012_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: Several individuals are seen walking along a paved area. One person in a light blue shirt appears to trip and fall, and another individual in a darker outfit runs towards them. A third person in a white shirt approaches the fallen individual. The scene is well-lit, suggesting it's nighttime, and there are people standing around observing the situation.

2. **Reason**: The actions suggest a potential altercation or fight, as the individual who tripped is now being approached by others, which could indicate an attempt to help or intervene. However, the initial fall seems accidental rather than intentional.

3. **Double-check**: The context does not clearly indicate that this is a fight or any form of abuse. The individuals appear to be in a public space, and there are no signs of aggression or injury beyond the initial fall. The behavior of the individuals approaching the fallen person suggests concern rather than hostility.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations, there is no clear evidence of deviant behavior such as fighting, abuse, or any other listed categories. The scene appears to be a minor incident where someone has fallen and others are trying to assist.

5. **Answer**: 0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Assault/Assault011_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video captures a busy street scene with several individuals walking around, some interacting with parked motorcycles. There are no signs of abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, shooting, or riots/crowd violence. People appear to be going about their daily activities without any apparent conflict or harm.

2. **Reason**: The scene does not show any clear instances of deviant behavior such as non-consensual harm, mutual violence, traffic collisions, deliberate ignition, gunfire, or collective disorder. The individuals seem to be engaged in normal pedestrian activity.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the video, there are no hidden conflicts or suspicious activities that were initially overlooked. The interactions among people appear casual and routine.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and re-evaluation, there is no evidence of deviant behavior in this video clip.

ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Burglary/Burglary004_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video shows a nighttime scene inside what appears to be a convenience store. A person wearing a dark hoodie and jeans enters through a broken glass door, carrying a bag. They proceed to smash the glass further with a tool, creating more debris. Another individual in a white shirt and jeans enters shortly after, also carrying a bag. Both individuals appear to be involved in a burglary attempt, as they are seen searching the store and moving quickly around the area.

2. **Reason**: The actions of the individuals clearly indicate a criminal act of breaking into a store with the intent to steal. The destruction of the glass door and the hurried movements suggest a premeditated plan to enter without authorization.

3. **Double-check**: The context of the scene, the presence of tools used to break the glass, and the individuals' actions all point towards a burglary. There are no signs of other deviant behaviors such as abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, or riots.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, this video clip clearly depicts a criminal act of burglary.

ANSWER

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Burglary/Burglary018_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: A person is seen entering a building through a doorway. They appear to be carrying something in their hands and are moving quickly. The area is dimly lit, and there are parked cars nearby. The person's movements seem hurried, and they do not interact with anyone else in the scene.

2. **Reason**: The person's actions suggest they might be trying to enter the building without being noticed, which could indicate an attempt to commit theft or vandalism. However, there is no direct evidence of such behavior in this single frame. The person's quick movement and lack of interaction with others could also be due to a legitimate reason like rushing into a meeting or an emergency situation.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the person's actions remain unclear. There is no clear indication of any illegal activity, but the hurried nature of their movement and the lack of interaction with others raise some concerns.

4. **Decide**: Given the limited information, it is difficult to definitively conclude that there is any deviant behavior. The person's actions could be interpreted in various ways, and there is not enough evidence to label this as deviant behavior.

5. **Respond**: 0

The garage floor has some scattered debris, possibly from previous work or cleaning.

2. **Reason**: The action of loading a motorcycle into the back of a truck does not inherently indicate any deviant behavior. It seems like a routine activity, possibly related to transportation or storage. There are no signs of abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, shooting, or riot/crowd violence.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, there are no indications of any harmful or illegal activities. The person is simply performing a task that does not involve any form of violence or criminal behavior.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, this video clip does not contain any clear act of deviant, abnormal, or criminal behavior.

ANSWER  
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Burglary/Burglary026_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: A person enters a room through a window, carrying a bicycle. They quickly move around the room, seemingly searching for something or someone, before leaving the room with the bicycle.
2. **Reason**: The person's actions suggest they may be trying to hide or avoid detection, which could indicate a secretive or potentially illegal activity. However, there is no clear evidence of abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, shooting, or riot/crowd violence.
3. **Double-check**: The room appears to be a private residence, and the person's movements are quick and somewhat hurried, which might suggest they are trying to avoid being seen. However, without further context or clearer evidence of intent, it is difficult to definitively classify this as deviant behavior.
4. **Decide**: Given the limited information and the lack of clear indicators of any of the deviant behaviors listed, the decision is based on insufficient evidence to categorize this as deviant behavior.
5. **Respond**: 0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Burglary/Burglary034_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video shows a dimly lit café interior with tables, chairs, and a counter. There's a yellow caution sign on the floor near the entrance. A person wearing dark clothing enters the frame, walks quickly towards the counter, and exits the frame shortly after. The camera captures a blue light flash, possibly from a police car's siren, indicating emergency presence. The environment appears calm without any visible signs of distress or conflict among individuals.

2. **Reason**: The person entering the café seems to be moving hurriedly, which could suggest urgency or fear. However, there is no direct evidence of abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, shooting, or riot/crowd violence. The blue light might indicate a police presence, but there's no clear indication of criminal behavior or disorder.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the person's quick movement and the blue light do not provide strong grounds for categorizing this as deviant behavior. The environment remains static, and there are no additional actions that suggest any form of criminal activity.

4. **Decide**: Based on the observations and reasoning, there is no clear evidence of deviant behavior in the video.

ANSWER

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Explosion/Explosion035_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video starts in a cluttered office space where a fire breaks out, engulfing the room in smoke. Two individuals are seen running through a different area, possibly a classroom or dining room, with a hose. They appear to be trying to extinguish the fire. The environment is chaotic, with papers and furniture scattered around.

2. **Reason**: The presence of a fire and the individuals' actions suggest an attempt to control or put out the fire. However, the initial scene of the office being engulfed in flames indicates a significant hazard that could lead to injury or property damage.

3. **Double-check**: The focus shifts quickly from the office to the individuals with the hose, indicating a response to the fire. The urgency and movement suggest a serious situation, but there's no clear evidence of abuse, fighting, car accidents, shooting, or riot/crowd violence in the latter part of the video.

4. **Decide**: While the initial scene involves a fire, which can be considered a hazardous event, the subsequent actions do not clearly fit into any of the deviant behavior categories listed. The individuals seem to be responding to the emergency rather than engaging in deviant behavior.

5. **Answer**: 0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Explosion/Explosion036_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video depicts a group of individuals in what appears to be a public area, possibly a courtyard or open space near a building. There are manhole covers on the ground, and the area looks like it could be part of a residential or commercial complex. Several individuals are seen walking around, and there's a person lying on the ground in the initial frames. As time progresses, more people gather, and some appear to be involved in a physical altercation. One individual is seen being restrained by others, and there's a sense of chaos as more people join in.

2. **Reason**: The presence of a physical altercation involving multiple individuals suggests that there might be fighting occurring. The individuals seem to be engaging in a struggle, which aligns with the category of "Fighting." The level of confidence is moderate because the exact nature of the fight isn't entirely clear, but the body language and movement suggest a physical confrontation.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the focus remains on the group dynamics and the physical interaction among the individuals. The context of the location and the number of participants involved further supports the classification of this as a "Fighting" event. There are no clear signs of abuse, car accidents, explosions, shooting, or riot/crowd violence.

There is a sudden commotion where this individual seems to throw something towards the staff member, who reacts by stepping back. The individual then exits the frame quickly. The staff member remains near the counter, appearing startled.

2. **Reason**: The individual in dark clothing appears to have thrown an object towards the staff member, which could be interpreted as an act of aggression or violence. However, there is no clear evidence of mutual violence or fighting between the two parties. The staff member's reaction suggests surprise rather than retaliation.

3. **Double-check**: The scene does not show any signs of mutual violence or fighting. The staff member's reaction seems more like a defensive response rather than an aggressive one. The individual in dark clothing exits the frame without further interaction, and there is no indication of continued conflict.

The cashier is standing behind the register, interacting with the customer. Various items such as money, receipts, and a Red Bull can are scattered around the counter. The timestamp indicates that this event occurred on March 28, 2015, at approximately 23:11:10.

2. **Reason**: The customer is seen reaching into the cash register, which could indicate an attempt to steal money or items. However, there is no direct evidence of violence or abuse. The cashier seems to be reacting to the customer's actions, possibly trying to stop them. The scene does not show any signs of fighting, car accidents, explosions, fires, arsons, or shootings.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the video, the customer's actions seem suspicious, but there is no clear indication of a deliberate criminal act like theft or robbery. The cashier's reaction suggests a defensive posture, but without further context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the interaction.

4. **Decide**: Based on the limited information available, the video does not clearly depict any of the deviant behaviors listed. The situation appears to be a potentially suspicious but not definitively criminal interaction.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Fighting/Fighting018_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video depicts a confrontation in a dimly lit corridor where a person appears to be defending themselves against another individual who is attacking them. The attacker is seen falling to the ground after being struck, and there are bystanders present in the background observing the situation. The setting suggests a public space, possibly a shopping mall or similar indoor area.

2. **Reason**: The scenario involves a self-defense situation where one individual is defending themselves against another. The attacker falls to the ground after being struck, indicating that the defender used force to neutralize the threat. This does not fit the categories of abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion/fire/arson, shooting, or riot/crowd violence. Instead, it aligns with a self-defense scenario, which is generally considered a positive action rather than deviant behavior.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the actions appear to be defensive and aimed at protecting oneself from harm. There are no signs of aggression towards others beyond the initial attack. The context of the environment and the presence of bystanders who do not intervene further supports the interpretation of this as a self-defense situation.

4. **Decide**: Given the analysis, the video does not contain any clear act of deviant, abnormal, or criminal behavior. It depicts a self-defense scenario, which is a positive action.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Fighting/Fighting042_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: A person wearing dark clothing enters a building through a glass door. They appear to be pushing or shoving the door open. Another individual follows closely behind. The first person then bends down, possibly to pick something up or inspect the floor. The second person stands nearby, observing. The floor has some debris scattered around, suggesting previous activity or disturbance.

2. **Reason**: The actions of the individuals suggest a possible struggle or confrontation. The first person's behavior of pushing the door open and bending down could indicate an attempt to gain entry or retrieve something. The second person's presence and observation might imply they are involved in the situation or are there to assist. However, there is no clear evidence of mutual violence or abuse.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the actions seem to be focused on gaining entry rather than engaging in a fight or other deviant behavior. The debris on the floor does not necessarily indicate a violent event but could be from a previous incident unrelated to the current interaction.

Another passenger nearby reacts by stepping back. The man who jumped onto the bench then sits down next to the fallen man. The scene appears to be a sudden, unexpected action without prior warning or provocation.

2. **Reason**: The sudden jump onto the bench and the resulting fall could be interpreted as a form of physical aggression or a prank, but there is no clear evidence of abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion, shooting, or riot/crowd violence. The actions seem to be spontaneous and not part of a larger event.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the actions appear to be isolated incidents without any indication of a larger pattern of deviant behavior. The passengers' reactions suggest surprise rather than anger or fear, which might indicate that this was not a planned or malicious act.

4. **Decide**: Given the lack of clear evidence of any of the deviant behaviors listed, the decision is based on the absence of such behaviors.

The motorcyclist suddenly falls off their bike and lies on the road. Another motorcyclist approaches and stops near the fallen rider. A car drives past the scene. The fallen rider remains on the road, and the second motorcyclist appears to be checking on them.
2. **Reason**: The motorcyclist has fallen off their bike and is lying on the road, which indicates a potential car accident or hit-and-run incident. There is no clear evidence of fighting, abuse, explosion, shooting, or riot/crowd violence.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Shooting/Shooting028_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: The video shows a workshop setting with various tools and equipment. A person is seen lying on the floor near a workbench. Another individual enters the room and appears to be searching for something, moving around the area. There is a significant amount of dust or smoke filling the room, obscuring visibility. The person on the floor remains motionless throughout the video.

2. **Reason**: The presence of dust or smoke suggests an explosion or fire, which could indicate an accidental ignition or deliberate arson. The person on the floor might have been injured or incapacitated due to the event. The lack of visible flames or other signs of fire makes it difficult to definitively classify this as an explosion or fire, but the smoke and the person's condition suggest a serious incident.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the scene, the smoke could be from a fire extinguisher being used, but the person on the floor does not appear to be reacting to a fire. The dust could be from a dust storm or a sudden release of particles, but the overall context and the person's condition suggest a more serious incident than just a dust storm.

4. **Decide**: Given the smoke and the person's condition, there is a strong possibility of an explosion or fire, even though the exact cause is unclear. However, without definitive evidence of fire or explosion, the most conservative classification would be based on the smoke and the person's condition.

5. **Respond**: Based on the observations and reasoning, the video contains a clear indication of an incident that could be classified as

The behavior appears to be a collective response to an unseen event rather than a premeditated act.

3. **Double-check**: Revisiting the frames, the individuals appear to be fleeing without any signs of aggression towards others or property damage. The context suggests a sudden evacuation rather than a planned deviant action.

4. **Decide**: Given the lack of clear evidence of any deviant behavior and the context of a possible emergency evacuation, the decision is that this video does not contain any clear act of deviant, abnormal, or criminal behavior.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Vandalism/Vandalism036_x264.mp4	1. **Observe**: A shirtless man enters a convenience store, approaches the counter, and appears to be reaching for something. He then suddenly throws a shelf unit filled with snacks and drinks towards the counter, causing it to fall and break. The man quickly exits the store after the commotion. The store has a Coca-Cola refrigerator and various shelves stocked with products.

2. **Reason**: The man's actions involve throwing a shelf unit, which results in significant damage to the store's property. This behavior aligns with the category of "Riot / Crowd violence" due to the intentional destruction of property and the sudden, disruptive nature of the action.

3. **Double-check**: There are no other individuals involved in the scene, so it doesn't qualify as a crowd violence event. However, the single individual's actions still constitute a form of property destruction, which is a component of riotous behavior.

4. **Decide**: Given that the man's actions result in property damage and there is no indication of a larger crowd or collective action, the behavior can be classified as a form of riotous or violent behavior.

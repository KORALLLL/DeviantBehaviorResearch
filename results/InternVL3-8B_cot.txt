PROMPT:



### Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Few-Shot Prompt  
*(one richly described example for each deviant-behaviour class, plus one negative example; the model must think aloud and end with a single-digit verdict)*

```text
ROLE  
You are an advanced vision–language model.  
Your task is to inspect a short video clip and decide whether it contains any clear act of deviant, abnormal, or criminal behaviour.

A clip is POSITIVE (1) if at least one of the following categories is observed with high confidence; otherwise it is NEGATIVE (0):

• Abuse – non-consensual harming of a vulnerable victim  
• Fighting – two or more people mutually exchanging violence  
• Car accident – traffic collision or hit-and-run incident  
• Explosion / Fire / Arson – deliberate or accidental ignition causing damage  
• Shooting – discharge of a firearm toward a target  
• Riot / Crowd violence – large-scale disorder with property destruction or assault  

THINKING PROTOCOL  
1. **Observe** – Describe salient visual elements (people, actions, objects, motion, context).  
2. **Reason** – Map observations to any deviance category; note level of confidence.  
3. **Double-check** – Rethink the scene for missed cues or false positives.  
4. **Decide** – Output 1 if any category matches; else 0.  
5. **Respond** – Show the full chain of thought for steps 1-4, then put the single digit **alone** on the final line.

==================== FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES ====================

— ABUSE —
EXAMPLE A  
[VIDEO]: Indoor nanny-cam, evening. A caregiver in medical scrubs lifts a frail elderly woman from a wheelchair, then abruptly drops her onto the bed. The woman winces and clutches her hip; a glass of water spills. Caregiver’s face shows irritation, mutters angrily while pointing a finger close to the woman’s face.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Vulnerable elder, forceful handling, pain reaction, aggressive gestures; no medical urgency.  
2. Reason: Non-consensual harm to a dependent victim → Abuse. High confidence.  
3. Double-check: No medical equipment in use, caregiver’s tone hostile, victim distressed. Decision stands.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— FIGHTING —
EXAMPLE F  
[VIDEO]: Nighttime street, two smartphone angles. Two men shove each other outside a club; one removes his jacket, adopts a boxing stance. Punches exchanged; a bystander tries to separate them but is kicked by a third participant. Flashing neon lights, crowd circles, some film with phones. Blood visible on one combatant’s nose.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Reciprocal punches, multiple aggressors, injuries evident, chaotic environment.  
2. Reason: Mutual physical violence between adults → Fighting.  
3. Double-check: No referee or sporting gear; nightclub exit context implies non-sport scenario. Confirm deviance.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— CAR ACCIDENT —
EXAMPLE C  
[VIDEO]: Daytime dash-cam. Car travels at 60 km/h on wet highway. A truck ahead swerves; its unsecured ladder slides off, striking a motorcyclist in the adjacent lane. Motorcyclist loses balance, skids across asphalt, sparks fly from bike. Nearby cars brake hard; one rear-ends another. Airbags deploy in the second car.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Roadway mishap, object falling, collision sequence, injuries likely.  
2. Reason: Traffic collision causing harm → Car accident.  
3. Double-check: Weather wet, but primary trigger is ladder impact; definite accident.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— EXPLOSION / FIRE / ARSON —
EXAMPLE E  
[VIDEO]: CCTV of gas-station forecourt at dawn. A hooded individual places a small device under the fuel-pump housing, retreats behind a parked van, presses a remote. Device flashes, pump erupts in fireball; security glass shatters, flames spread beneath canopy. Attacker flees vehicle at high speed. Smoke alarms trigger; sprinklers activate.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Intentional placement of device, timed detonation, rapid fire spread.  
2. Reason: Deliberate ignition causing property damage → Arson / Explosion.  
3. Double-check: No accidental spark visible; attacker’s deliberate retreat confirms intent.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— SHOOTING —
EXAMPLE S  
[VIDEO]: Body-cam from police officer at dusk. Officer takes cover behind squad car; an armed suspect across parking lot fires three handgun rounds toward officer. Muzzle flashes, bullet impacts on cruiser door. Officer issues commands, radios for backup. Shattered glass litters ground. Civilians crouch behind parked cars.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Firearm discharged toward human target, immediate danger.  
2. Reason: Use of gun in assault → Shooting.  
3. Double-check: Target is law-enforcement; hostile intent clear.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— RIOT / CROWD VIOLENCE —
EXAMPLE R  
[VIDEO]: Aerial drone footage over city square during protest. Hundreds push against police barricade; several overturn a patrol motorcycle and ignite it with a flare. Others hurl cobblestones pulled from pavement; storefront windows crack. Tear-gas plumes drift; officers advance in phalanx formation; some protesters wield metal poles as improvised weapons.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Large crowd, coordinated property destruction, assaults on police, fire ignition.  
2. Reason: Collective violent disorder → Riot / Crowd violence.  
3. Double-check: Scale large, multiple simultaneous violent acts. Confirm deviance.  
4. Decide: 1  
ANSWER  
1

----------------------------------------------------------
— NEGATIVE BENIGN CASE —
EXAMPLE N  
[VIDEO]: Afternoon picnic by a lake. Friends set up blankets, toss frisbee, grill food. A child helps an elder adjust a sunhat; a dog naps beside them. Calm water, laughter, no aggressive motions, no hazardous objects.  
THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Leisure activity, cooperative gestures, relaxed environment.  
2. Reason: No harm, threat, or unlawful act visible.  
3. Double-check: Scan for hidden conflict, weapons, or dangerous behaviour; none found.  
4. Decide: 0  
ANSWER  
0

ThOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Security camera footage of a convenience store with employees and customers. A maniled on the counter appears to be suspicious; another male figure approaches, and one of the store employees goes to the back of the store.
2. Reason: The behavior could be interpreted as surveillance or theft preparation (taking the employee's attention away from customers or hiding items in the stock). While not definitive, the sequence raises suspicion.
3. Double-check: No clear act of theft, violence, or any other explicit deviance seen. The clip focuses on movement that could be normal store activity.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Arson/Arson008_x264.mp4	1

THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: The video starts with a timestamped shot from CCTV, showing the interior of a dimly lit room with sofas and a reception desk. A person appears near the reception area, and a sudden bright flash occurs towards the end. The scene is then returned to grayscale with a "Replay" label at the same timestamp. A return bright flash happens again. The room reverts to grayscale afterward. The video concludes with the display "Subscribe to RollCall2go Daily Law Enforcement Media and Training."
2. Reason: The flash of light seen in these scene suggests a potential explosion, fire, or intentional ignition. The suddenness and intensity of the brightness could indicate an explosion or fire. The room goes back to grayscale after the flash, which is typical in CCTV footage when the camera adjusts for bright light or a change in the light source. This type behavior is indicative of an accidental or deliberate ignition, which could lead to property damage or danger.
3. Double-check: The timestamps indicate rapid events, with a sudden bright flash at two different parts of the footage. The transition to grayscale again suggests a reset due to the flash, consistent with an explosion or fire disrupting the recording.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Assault/Assault007_x264.mp4	I observe a security camera view from what appears to be a bank or financial facility. A person is lying on the ground, seemingly un incapacitated or unconscious, next near an ATM machine. A second individual enters the scene carrying what looks like a cleaning or maintenance tool, possibly a broom, and uses it to strike the person on the ground. No injuries from the tool are visible. Two additional individuals then enter, approaching with what appear to be protective gear and masks, suggesting they could be security or staff involved in the situation.

Reasoning: The use of a weapon-like object to strike another person could be interpreted as abuse or assault. The presence of multiple individuals possibly indicating an arrest or restraining situation.

Double-check: The sequence involves a non of coercion or restraint using the tool, with subsequent appearance of what might be security personnel. The context does not suggest mutual violence or a crowd-based assault scenario, nor does it show signs of a fire, explosion, or car accident. The actions do align with potential abuse due to non's non on the victim during a likely attempt to apprehend or neutralize a person.

Decide: 1  
ANSWER 1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Assault/Assault012_x264.mp4	1. Observe: The scene is an outdoor urban area at night, with people walking and interactions. Two individuals appear to engage in a physical altercation, with one falling to the ground.

2. Reason: The act of one person attacking another, resulting in the second being on the ground, constitutes Fighting.

3. Double-check: No indication of mutual combat, but the presence of an aggressive act against a single individual suggests criminal intent.

4. Decide: 1

ANSWER
1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Assault/Assault011_x264.mp4	1. Observe: The video shows an outdoor area with numerous motorcycles parked in rows. Several people are present, casually walking in different directions. There are interactions, but they dont involve physical conflict. Some people are engaged in conversation or moving near the parked motorcycles. The environment seems busy but not chaotic.

2. Reason: While the video contains normal pedestrian activity and multiple individuals interacting, there’s no evidence of any deviant behavior such as fighting, abuse, car accidents, explosions, shootings, or riots.

3. Double-check: Confirm that all observed are focused on normal activity, with no visible incident or abnormal actions.

1. Observe: Two individuals are forcefully attempting entry into an ATM enclosed booth using a vehicle, throwing a metal box onto the structure and climbing over it, causing visible structural damage.  
2. Reason: The actions involve forced entry into a secured area, with two individuals working collaboratively and deliberately using tools to gain access; this constitutes an act of criminal behavior.
3. Double-check: The presence of a vehicle involved in the break-in adds to the criminal intent, as it’s commonly associated with vehicle-assisted burglaries. The damage to the structure and their focused efforts on forced access indicate unlawful activity.
4. Decide: 1

ANSWER
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Burglary/Burglary026_x264.mp4	1. Observe: A person dressed in a white hoodie attempts to climb out of a window, struggling with their position. The individual later re-enters the window and manipulates the blinds from inside within the indoor room.

2. Reason: The video depicts an individual attempting an exit or entry through a window, which, though not life-threatening or targeting another person, might imply trespassing or burglary attempts. However, there is no evidence of harm, intentional violence, or the use of weapons. The context provided by the timestamp and setting doesn't suggest illegal activity, such as shooting, fighting, or arson.

3. Double-check: There is no interaction with another individual, and no property damage or aggressive actions are evident. The actions appear to be an individual’s struggle with window entry/exit, which is ambiguous but doesn't directly fit the criteria for clear deviant or criminal behavior in this context.

4. Decide: 0

ANSWER
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Burglary/Burglary034_x264.mp4	1. Observe: The scene is of an indoor area with tables and chairs, with a caution sign on the floor. Two people appear in sequence, moving aggressively, possibly engaging in an altercation.  
2. Reason: One person appears to swing a chair, which could suggest violence. However, there is no clear definitive physical contact or aggressive behavior such as punching or kicking shown in these frames. The movements are abrupt and suggestive of tension but lack the clear indicators of fighting as stated in the fighting category.  
3. Double-check: The individuals seem to be interacting quickly, but no physical assault is clearly evident from these specific frames. The environment does not suggest a crowded or riotous situation. The observed behavior doesn’t necessarily align with any of the specific categories mentioned except for potentially a struggle or a disagreement.  
4. Decide: 0  
ANSWER
0
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Burglary/Burglary033_x264.mp4	THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: A person knocks on a door at night, then suddenly the door closes and the person retreats. The setting is illuminated by an overhead porch light, with outdoor elements like potted plants and a car visible.  
2. Reason: The action of knocking appears benign, but the sudden retreat of the individual could be seen as suspicious; however, without explicit aggressive intent or harm, it doesn't readily align with categories of abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion/fire/arson, shooting, or riot/crowd violence.  
3. Double-check: The sequence lacks evidence of harm, intentional destruction, or aggressive behavior—there's no clear deviance beyond possibly an unsettlingly quick departure.

1. Observe: Surveillance footage from a high vantage point showing a male suspect wearing a multi-colored baseball cap, a white t-shirt, and black jeans. The suspect is observed down a stairway, walking along a sidewalk, and returning to the stairway carrying what appears to be a tool. There is a blue vehicle with police markings parked on the street.
2. Reason: The suspect’s presence at the location of a commercial burglary, combined with his actions of holding a tool, suggests he is involved in criminal activity. This aligns with the description of a suspect mentioned in the missing person and burglary notice.
3. Double-check: The time stamp on the surveillance footage indicates it was recorded on 0116-06-12- 05:34:46, which matches the incident timeline mentioned in the notice.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Explosion/Explosion002_x264.mp4	1

Observe: Nighttime gas station setting, two individuals interact near a fuel pump; at one individual holds a cell phone that unexpectedly sparks and ignites nearby fuel, resulting in a small explosion. The other person, dressed in casual attire, reacts by stepping away quickly. A third man in a red shirt appears, approaching the scene, and appears to be talking to the first person.

Reason: The ignition of fuel follows the cell phone, resulting in a fire, which is an intentional act likely to cause damage or danger. Although the fire is small, the potential for explosion and injury is clear. This event crosses the boundaries of an accidental spill or minor mishap.

Double-check: The footage sequence shows clearly shows a deliberate action triggering the ignition, given the proximity of the cell phone to the fuel pump. The escalation into a fire indicates potential consequences beyond simple mistake.

Decide: 1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Explosion/Explosion004_x264.mp4	1

Thoughts:
1. Observe: At the beginning, two individuals appear to be setting up some equipment on the exterior of a building, possibly a house. There appears to be some slight struggle or collision between them, but it is not clear if it is aggressive. As the video progresses, one of them removes their mask, revealing face, and there is some tension between them. Towards the end, one individual backs away quickly, while the other runs to the other and there is some an exchange of an object.
2. Reason: The initial activity seems to be preparation for something, possibly maintenance, but the behavior becomes suspicious when the individuals become more agitated. The struggle over the object or bag in the final exchange indicates a potential theft or a transaction gone wrong, which could be considered as deviant behavior.
3. Double-check: There are no tools or firearms visible, and the setting is a residential area, which reduces the likelihood of it being a planned crime. However, the aggressive behavior and the object exchange strongly indicate an offense.
4. Decide: 1

Answer:
1
/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Explosion/Explosion006_x264.mp4	THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: The video frames depict a public-town square with multiple explosions occurring near parked and moving cars, causing damage. Pedestrians are seen running away in response.  
2. Reason: The explosions suggest deliberate ignition or accidental ignition causing significant property damage, aligning with an explosion/arson category. The presence of multiple vehicles being damaged further supports this.
3. Double-check: The explosions are focused on at, not accidental, as the context seems calm prior to the incidents, indicating arson. The damage seen on vehicles corroborates this assessment.

1. Observe: Group of men outside building entrance, one holding a bright object emitting sparks, another grabbing his arm; bystanders in the vicinity.  
2. Reason: Object being handled by the man emitting sparks suggests potential for explosive effect, indicating risky behavior. Bystanders’ avoidance and the nature of the object imply a dangerous activity. This scenario doesn't approach the violent intensity of fighting or the scale of a riot, but it carries high risk of unintended harm, aligning with potential explosion/arson.  
3. Double-check: No visible flames or fire, but sparks suggest possible ignition device. No direct indication of intent to cause widespread damage like in a riot. Focus on controlled use of sparks might suggest an attempted crime, possibly arson or preparatory explosive action.

Observe: The video depicts a street scene with vehicles parked and moving. A person near a fire extinguisher sprays a significant amount of extinguishing material towards an intense flame in the background. This action persists with a fire erupting multiple times, likely causing destruction, followed by a return to normalcy without further flames.

Reason: The action appears to be an attempt to extinguish a fire, possibly accidental or intentional. However, the significant presence of fire and extinguishing action does align with a potential arson or explosion context. However, considering the context might be an emergency response rather than deliberate harm, the primary observation is a fire outbreak without clear evidence of intent to cause harm.

Double-check: While the flames and extinguishing action are present, there's no explicit indication or confirmation of arson (intentional to cause fire). The presence of the individual with the extinguisher and responding activity suggest an emergency rather than deviant behavior such as arson.

The scene begins with a person seemingly lying on the ground, while others stand around, possibly involved in restraining. Suddenly, there's an eruption of smoke or dust, causing the individuals to react differently, some some stumbling backward. More people then gather around the area, assisting others, which indicates there was an unexpected incident, possibly related to a collision or accident. The presence of several bystanders gathered after the disturbance also contributes to suspicion of a violent confrontation or accident. Although there are brief movements of fleeing, the lack of clear evidence of intentional violence or shooting limits the conclusion to a potential accident or mutual struggle causing commotion. However, given the visible tension and multiple people involved, it leans toward crowd-related deviance without clear shooting or arson.

/mnt/datasets/ucf_crime/Explosion/Explosion039_x264.mp4	The video depicts an incident captured on a restaurant camera. A customer, accompanied by a child, appears in the restaurant and makes an alarming gesture with his right hand to the cashier. The cashier's reaction and the aftermath suggest the customer might have held something unusual, such as a weapon, threatening the establishment. There's visible panic in the scene, as other the cashier quickly exits the area and the customer's hurried departure implies a fear response. The absence of significant violence between multiple individuals and the lack of any fiery or explosive elements or a clear discharge of a firearm indicates it’s more aligned with an act of potential intimidation or a false alarm rather than specific categories like shooting or riot. 

**THOUGHTS**
1. Observe: A customer confronts the cashier, exits swiftly, and customer with child reacts with quick movement. No signs of mutual violence, fire, fire-arm discharge, or a large crowd engagement.
2. Reason: The gesture and immediate evacuation hint at a threat, possibly a weapon, causing panic. This does not fulfill the precise criteria for abuse, fighting, car accident, explosion/arson, or shooting. It absence of explicit destructive behavior or large-scale disorder reduces this to not meet the riot threshold.

1. Observe: A person enters a white car parked on a street, gets inside into an argument with another individual who emerges from the driver's side, and then attempts to drive into the car causing damage.  
2. Reason: The act of forcefully pushing or crashing into another's vehicle could be considered driving action, but the immediate violent behavior and aggression suggest a potential for criminal behavior, possibly considered as a form of abuse or destruction. However, without explicit evidence of a firearm, explosion, or intent to destroy property on arson, and given the lack of confirmation of a deliberate, premeditated act of violence, it does not conclusively meeting the threshold for shooting or arson, and fits closer to riot or destruction but falls short due to the limited scope and apparent immediacy of an altercation with no broader pattern of criminality.  
3. Double-check: The action described a clear, isolated incident of potential aggression but lacks the scale or intent of a riot or arson. It no visible injuries, no weapon, and no fire or explosion, so it does not align with the high confidence required for some categories.

THOUGHTS  
1. Observe: Sidewalk scene in front of a shop, vehicles on the road, people moving, broken glass near the entrance. A person wearing a white shirt appears hurriedly, possibly involved in an incident.
2. Reason: Potential disturbance could involve vandalism due to the broken glass and someone’s quick departure from or arrival at the scene near the broken glass. However, without a clear sight of an active weapon, direct force exchange, property damage caused by force, fire, or any form of evident shooting, this level of evidence is insufficient for confirmed deviance.
3. Double-check: No clear signs of fighting, shooting, explosion, intentional fire, or large-scale violent crowd behavior evident. The broken glass and quick actions could suggest incident proximity, but the lack of visible conclusive action linking to the glass shatters the certainty needed for a category violation.

People are walking, interacting, and no immediate harm or injury is visible initially. A red bus arrives, and individuals move around the area. One person moves quickly towards a car with urgency, opens the door before exits; another person stands at a distance. The sequence includes cars moving slowly out of the parking lot.

2. Reason: The scenario includes activities that are generally non - parking, walking, and leaving the car park. However, the person opening the car door and running immediately gets into the vehicle and starts driving away quickly could potentially be associated with escaping a conflict or responding, which could be seen as evasive behavior. However, without clear evidence of imminent threat or danger, it's not clearly deviant behavior.

3. Double-check: No explicit signs of conflict such as yelling, aggressive gestures, or confrontations. The person moving quickly could just as easily be late for a non event, and there's no visible harm to others. Similarly, the others in the footage do not indicate any abnormal behavior.

— Observation — 
The video takes place in a grocery store aisle. Initially, a man in a blue sweater observes the offerings while a female in a white coat approaches him, seems to discuss something, and then walks away after handing him a package. Various shoppers move in and out, browsing items and moving along the aisles. 

— Reason — 
The interaction between the male in the blue sweater and the female in the white coat involves only a brief physical contact (a package handover) and appears to be non non-aggressive or harmful nature. This cannot be interpreted as an act of abuse or non-consensual violence. There is no evidence of physical alter, mutual physical violence, traffic collision, deliberate or accidental ignition, discharge of a firearm, or large-scale riotous behavior.

— Double-check — 
Reviewing the interactions and motions, no signs of abuse, fighting, car accidents, explosions, shootings, or rioting are visible. The scene remains consistent with everyday grocery shopping activities.
